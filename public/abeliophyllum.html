        <strong>Abeliophyllum (White Forsythia, or Korean Abelialeaf)</strong> is a monotypic genus of flowering plants
        in the olive
        family, Oleaceae. It consists of one species,<strong> Abeliophyllum distichum</strong> Nakai, endemic to Korea,
        where it is
        endangered in the wild, occurring at only seven sites. It is related to Forsythia, but differs in having white,
